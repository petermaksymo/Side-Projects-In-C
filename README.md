# Side-Projects-In-C

Welcome!

This repository will be for storing/exhibiting some of my side projects in C. These projects are not part of any of my courses but insted, ones that I thought would be neat to do.

Inside each .c file, there will be a little bit of detail, before the code, about the project such as a description, completion date, completion time...
